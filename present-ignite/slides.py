1. YOUR MEETINGS SUCK: LESSONS FROM OCCUPY TO MAKE THEM SUCK LESS.

Hi! So in case you weren't aware, your meetings are absolutely unbearable. At Occupy Wall Street, we tried to make our meetings suck a little bit less, and this is what we came up with.

Participant observation is welcome during this talk.

""",

"""
2. HI, I'M AJ. </3 AUTHORITY.

So, I'm AJ, I dislike authority and vertical hierarchy, especially vertical hierarchy that pretends to be horizontal.

First of all, I just want to say that I can't convey the meaning of the Occupy movement in a 5-minute talk, but feel free to ask me about it after.
""",

"""
3. LEADERLESS DECISION-MAKING IS HARD. LEFT UNCHECKED, IT DRAGS ON FOREVER. SOUND FAMILIAR?

You know how meetings suck horribly as soon as you have more than a few people in them? Well, try to guess what happens when you have tens or hundreds or thousands of people where everyone has an equal voice (and a lot to say).

""",

"""
4. [PICTURES]

What happens is that your general assemblies last  F O R E V E R (kind of like work meetings).
To survive them, we adopted two sets of techniques that I’m going to teach you so you can apply them to your work meetings while preserving your sanity.

""",

"""
5. PART I: [dis]agreement

So the first thing is that during meetings, a lot of time is spent saying “I agree” (or “disagree”), all while trying to hedge around other people's feelings.
So like “Oh yeah, I totally see what you’re saying, and I think that’s a good point, and it must be said that...”

""",
"""
6. [AGREE SIGNAL]

Enough of that. That can all be replaced by a few hand signals, the first of which is simply this: <demonstrate>
It comes from the American Sign Language sign for applause.
Call it “jazz hands,” “twinkles”, whatever you want.

""",

"""
7. HOW TO DISAGREE DURING MEETINGS? TRADITIONAL ADVICE: USE LOTS OF WORDS!

So how do we disagree? The traditional approach is to use lots of very polite words, which is nice but takes forever.
Instead, we have three hand signals to achieve the same result.
""",

"""
8. HOW TO DISAGREE DURING MEETINGS? A BETTER WAY: HAND SIGNALS

When you’re neutral or have reservations about what’s being said, do this: <demonstrate>
When you disagree, do the same thing, but with your fingers pointing down.
And you do this <demonstrate> when you’re so opposed to something that you’ll leave the movement if it passes.
""",

"""
9. PART II: Talking
Cool, so now that we’ve eliminated 50% of unnecessary words during meetings, let’s pare it down even further.
So what about when you have something to say beyond yes or no?

It boils down to 2 rules:
- If you must talk, be quick about it
- Don't interrupt.
""",

"""
10. THE STACK

To manage this, we had a person in charge of keeping track of what we call the stack. If you have something to say, raise your hand and they will write your name down. When it is turn, you have 30 seconds to talk. This solves most interruptions.
""",

"""
11. BUT BUT BUT

But you know how sometimes you just have one tiny comment or question and you know it’s rude
to interrupt but you just want to say this one thing real quick?

And how infuriating it is how in meetings, one person can sit there with their
hand raised forever, while another one commands total attention when they inhale? -_-
""",

"""
12. INTERRUPTIONS: SOME ARE OK. MOST ARE NOT.

Well, there’s a hand signal for that. Three, actually. The first of which is...

""",
"""
13.  DIRECT RESPONSE SIGNAL
The first one is called the direct response, it looks like this, and it gets you 10 seconds or less to provide a correction or a quick piece of UNOPINIONATED information.

""",

"""
14. Point of clarification

A point of clarification is a single hand formed in the shape of a C, and it means that someone has a question that needs to be
answered before that person can vote on an issue.
""",

"""
15. POINT OF ORDER (back on topic, please)

Point of order (or point of process) means that the conversation has strayed
from the original topic.
The beauty of this one is that it almost always speaks for itself--people will autocorrect when they see it.

""",

"""
16. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE
Last, but not least. This is the single thing I learned at Occupy that I desperately wish I could do during work meetings without being seen as rude.
“Wrap it up” means, “We hear you, and we get it. You can move on.”
""",

"""
17. CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE

I should mention that Occupy Wall Street didn’t invent this stuff. 
We adapted techniques from the long tradition of anarchists, who are extremely organized during their meetings.
I encourage you to read about it!

""",

"""
19. TL;DR: hand signals > words

Leaderless decision-making is worthwhile even though it can be hard. 

Traditionally marginalized groups have great ideas, but they won’t be heard or respected when there is always someone controlling discussion.

""",
"""
20. CONGRATULATIONS!

You’ve just:
* Helped introverts to contribute.
* Eliminated interruptions.
* Reduced the effects of gender bias.
* Replaced your boss (maybe).
* Cut your meeting time in half.

""",

"""

first signal, it's something from american sign language

then how to do we disagree, we try to explain to people, "well actually", and it often no only shows disrespect but


the idea is to keep interruptions short

You know when people are trying to make a point and they go on forever
Here's the thing: like half of the words spoken at meetings amount to:
- Agreement or disagreement, or
- this thing linguists call hedging, as in padding your speech to respect other people's egos, or
- my personal least favorite: opinions expressed at torturous length

First, let's look at how we express agreement.
18. CRED
17. It's a way of life
These techniques are most necessary with large meetings or assemblies where egalitarian/decentralized decision making is important.

But once people get used to this style, it becomes less necessary in smaller meetings.
